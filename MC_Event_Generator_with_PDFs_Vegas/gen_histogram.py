"""
reference: https://matplotlib.org/xkcd/examples/api/histogram_path_demo.html

This example shows how to use a path patch to draw a bunch of
rectangles.  The technique of using lots of Rectangle instances, or
the faster method of using PolyCollections, were implemented before we
had proper paths with moveto/lineto, closepoly etc in mpl.  Now that
we have them, we can draw collections of regularly shaped objects with
homogeous properties more efficiently with a PathCollection.  This
example makes a histogram -- its more work to set up the vertex arrays
at the outset, but it should be much faster for large numbers of
objects
